# Marvel & DC Heroes
***Actually a very small number of heroes***

This is an aplication that shows how to use The React Framework [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and styling every component using the one and only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Framework to help me develop this app in just 1 day :scream:

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.
